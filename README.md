## 📌 About the Project

This project focuses on numerical and iterative techniques to reduce the computational complexity of large-scale linear and multilinear dynamical systems. Model Order Reduction (MOR) helps in approximating high-dimensional models while preserving essential behavior, useful in control systems, simulations, and scientific computing.
